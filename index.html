                <h5>Business Implications:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Expense (41%, +8pp)</strong>: This significant increase indicates growing price sensitivity in the Kazakhstan market. Marketing should emphasize value offerings and affordable options to address this perception.</li>
                    <li><strong>Previous Visitation (24%, +12pp)</strong>: The substantial increase suggests that many Kazakhstani travelers who have visited Abu Dhabi are not motivated to return. This indicates a need to develop and promote new attractions, experiences, and reasons to revisit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visa Process (22%, -5pp)</strong>: The decrease suggests improvements in visa processing, but it remains a significant barrier. Continued efforts to streamline the visa process and communicate these improvements are needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flight Availability (18%, -3pp)</strong>: The slight decrease indicates some improvement in flight connections, but this remains a barrier for nearly one-fifth of potential visitors. Continued work with airlines to improve connectivity is important.</li>
                    <li><strong>Climate (15%, +2pp)</strong>: The slight increase in climate concerns suggests a need for better communication about indoor activities and seasonal variations in Abu Dhabi's weather.</li>

            <div class="example">
                <h5>Strategic Recommendation:</h5>
                <p>Based on these barriers, a "Value Discovery" campaign highlighting affordable experiences and packages (addressing the "Expense" barrier) combined with promotion of new attractions and experiences (addressing the "Previous Visitation" barrier) would address the two most significant barriers to visitation from the Kazakhstan market. This could be complemented with clear information about the simplified visa process to address the third most significant barrier.</p>
